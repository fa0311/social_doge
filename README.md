## What is this?

Developed as an alternative to Social Dog.

> It is a tool that solves all the challenges in Twitter marketing, such as "want to increase engagement" and "want to automate and streamline."

With the monetization of the Twitter API in May 2023, all major features of Social Dog became paid.

## Twitter's Terms of Service

I am not a legal expert, so I am not sure about the specifics, but this app may violate Twitter's terms of service.
Since there is a possibility of account suspension, it is recommended to log in with a secondary account.
The accounts being managed and the accounts being logged into can be separated.
